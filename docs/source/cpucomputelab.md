  - Direct ssh to the mad11 node
- AMD Turin
   - Direct ssh to the mad12 node
- [Intel Sapphire Rapids (2024)](#more-on-sapphire-rapids)
  - Direct ssh to the gi001 node
  - Via the dine2 Slurm partition (apply to join do015)
- AMD Bergamo (2023)
  - Via the cosma5 Slurm partition (apply to join hpcicc)

## More on Sapphire Rapids

### Node access

Our Sapphire Rapids are configured to hold Ponte Vecchio GPUs (PVCs). Therefore, they are accessible as part of our Intel GPU nodes.

(*) The nodes are given out FCFS, i.e. please check prior to any benchmarking that nobody else is currently using the node.

### Specification

- CPU name:       Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8480+
- Sockets:                2
- Cores per socket:       56
- Threads per core:       2

### Environment

As this is an Intel node while Cosma's login nodes are AMD, we recommend to compile exclusively on the node:

```sh
module load intel_comp
module load compiler-rt tbb compiler mpi
```

The module oneAPI should work as well.

### Performance

To assess the node's performance, we recommend to run

```sh
module load likwid
likwid-bench
```

Type in -a or -h to see an overview of the available metrics. Stream Triad and peak are the ones we usually recommend to look at first.
